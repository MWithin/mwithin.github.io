                            Hi! My name is Aporva Varshney, and I'm a PhD 
                            student in mathematics at University College London, 
                            aligned with the London School of Geometry and Number Theory. I study algebraic geometry, 
                            inspired by theoretical physics. 
                            I am also an avid programmer, having studied joint mathematics and computer science for my
                            undergraduate degree.

                            My research will be focusing on a branch of mathematics known as algebraic geometry,
                            which studies shapes that can be described by polynomials.
                            I am particularly interested in the links of this theory to concepts in theoretical 
                            physics such as string theory.
