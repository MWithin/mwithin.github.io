                            Hi! My name is Aporva Varshney, and I'm a PhD 
                            student in mathematics at University College London, 
                            aligned with the London School of Geometry and Number Theory. I study algebraic geometry, 
                            inspired by theoretical physics. 
                            I am also an avid programmer, having studied joint mathematics and computer science for my
                            undergraduate degree. Additionally, I spent my summers working at Bloomberg and Meta as a 
                            software engineering intern.

                            My research will be focusing on a branch of mathematics known as algebraic geometry,
                            which studies shapes that can be described by polynomials.
                            I am particularly interested in the links of this theory to concepts in theoretical 
                            physics such as string theory.

                            During my 12 week placement, I worked in a backend team which managed virtual
                            machines to be used by developers across the company. My project developed a 
                            solution to intelligently and automatically allocate hardware resources to 
                            each virtual machine.
                            Spikes in the loads on specific servers frequently lead to delays and downtime in the 
                            services provided by the team, and previously required manual intervention.
                            I utilised the knapsack algorithm and used various metrics to create heuristics
                            for performing the rebalancing.
                            The analysis of hardware utilisation was exposed through a user interface, and 
                            the data on previous outages was used to create a testbed.
