# Test Post

This is a test post designed to test the overall workflow.
We want to test **all** the features of _Markdown_, including the
text formatting, `inline code` and

```
giant code blocks
in the middle of the screen.
```

We want to support 

- Lists
- both unordered

1. and ordered
1. like
1. this

plus

## The Maths

A key feature will be the MathJax support. We need to have inline equations, since $\frac{1}{2} \pi \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} \zeta^{i} = 0$. Additionally,

$$
\begin{align*}
        & \operatorname{Spec} A_i/(T_1, \dots, T_m, z_r) \\ 
        & \cong \operatorname{Spec} A[T_1, \dots, \hat{T_r}, \dots, T_n]/(T_jz_r - z_j, T_1, \dots, T_m, z_r)_{j \neq r} \\
        & \cong \operatorname{Spec} (A/(z_1, \dots, z_n))[T_{m + 1}, \dots, T_n] \\
        & \cong \operatorname{Spec} K[T_{m + 1}, \dots, \hat{T_r}, \dots, T_n].
\end{align*}
$$

and we're done.
